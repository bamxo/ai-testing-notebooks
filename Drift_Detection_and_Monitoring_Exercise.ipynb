        "### Purpose:\n",
        "In this exercise, you will learn how to detect concept drift in data over time and understand how it impacts model predictions. Concept drift occurs when the statistical properties of data change between when the model was trained and when it is used, leading to reduced accuracy and performance\n",

        "### Objective:\n",
        "By the end of this exercise you wull be able to:\n",
        "1. Split a dataset to simulate training and new data.\n",
        "2. Detect and visualize drift using Evidently AI.\n",
